### :warning: 4. Steps for setting up the environment (Vite + React) :hammer_and_wrench:

Please follow the instructions below carefully:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup :

Find a file named ` .example.env`. This file serves as a template for the environment variables required to run the application. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`in the same directory.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Environment Variables :

Open the newly created `.env` file and update the values of the environment variables according to the platform we're working on (Vite + React). For example, you might need to set environment variables related to Firebase, API keys, or other configurations specific to our project.

Make sure to keep sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials, confidential and avoid committing them to the version control system.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Building the Project :

Once you've added the necessary environment variables, navigate to the `./client` directory in your terminal and run the following command to build the project:

`npm run build`

This command will generate the production-ready optimized build of our application.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Project :

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:

`npm run dev`

### Now go ahead and create a new branch and move to the branch

```
git checkout -b fix-issue-<ISSUE-NUMBER>
```

> **Note**: Replace `<ISSUE-NUMBER>` with the issue number you are working on

> Add new features or fix bugs according to your issue number

# To Push your changes

- `git status -s` (Shows the changed files)
- `git add --all` (Will add all the files to staging area)
